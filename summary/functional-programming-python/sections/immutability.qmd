# Immutability in Functional Programming

Immutability is a core concept in functional programming that refers to the inability to change a data structure after it has been created. This principle helps to avoid side effects and makes reasoning about code easier. In Python, while most built-in data types are mutable (like lists and dictionaries), there are immutable types such as tuples and frozensets that can be utilized to adhere to functional programming principles.

## Why Immutability Matters

1. **Predictability**: Immutable objects cannot be altered, which means that their state remains consistent throughout their lifetime. This predictability simplifies debugging and reasoning about code.

2. **Thread Safety**: Since immutable objects cannot change, they are inherently thread-safe. This means that multiple threads can access the same immutable object without the risk of data corruption.

3. **Functional Purity**: Immutability supports the concept of pure functions, which always produce the same output for the same input without side effects.

## Working with Immutable Data Structures in Python

### Tuples

Tuples are one of the simplest immutable data structures in Python. Once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified.
