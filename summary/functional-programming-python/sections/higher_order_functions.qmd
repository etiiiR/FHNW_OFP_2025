# Higher-Order Functions in Python

Higher-order functions are a key concept in functional programming. They are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results. This allows for a high degree of abstraction and code reuse, making programs more modular and easier to maintain.

## Definition

A higher-order function is defined as a function that either:

1. Takes one or more functions as arguments.
2. Returns a function as its result.

## Examples

### 1. Functions as Arguments

In Python, you can pass functions as arguments to other functions. This is useful for creating more generic and reusable code.
