# Functional Libraries in Python

Functional programming in Python is greatly enhanced by several libraries that provide tools and utilities to facilitate functional programming paradigms. This section will explore two of the most important libraries: `functools` and `itertools`.

## functools

The `functools` module is a standard library in Python that provides higher-order functions and operations on callable objects. It includes utilities for memoization, partial function application, and more.

### Example: Using `functools.reduce`

The `reduce` function is used to apply a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use it:
