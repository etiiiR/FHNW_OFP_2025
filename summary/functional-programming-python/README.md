# Functional Programming in Python

This project is dedicated to exploring the principles and practices of functional programming in Python. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of functional programming concepts, along with practical coding examples and detailed documentation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **Summary.qmd**: The main document summarizing functional programming in Python, featuring extensive coding examples and detailed explanations of various concepts.
  
- **_quarto.yml**: Configuration file for Quarto, specifying project settings and output formats.

- **code/**: This directory contains Python scripts demonstrating key functional programming concepts:
  - `higher_order_functions.py`: Examples of higher-order functions.
  - `immutability.py`: Illustrations of immutability in functional programming.
  - `recursion.py`: Examples of recursive functions.
  - `lambda_functions.py`: Demonstrations of lambda functions.

- **images/**: Contains visual aids to enhance understanding of functional programming concepts.
  - `fp_concept_map.svg`: A concept map visualizing functional programming principles.

- **sections/**: Contains individual documentation sections covering specific topics in functional programming:
  - `introduction.qmd`: Introduction to functional programming.
  - `first_class_functions.qmd`: Discussion on first-class functions.
  - `pure_functions.qmd`: Explanation of pure functions.
  - `immutability.qmd`: Detailed look at immutability.
  - `higher_order_functions.qmd`: In-depth exploration of higher-order functions.
  - `recursion.qmd`: Focus on recursion and its applications.
  - `comprehensions.qmd`: Discussion on comprehensions in Python.
  - `functional_libraries.qmd`: Overview of functional programming libraries in Python.

- **bibliography.bib**: Contains references and citations used throughout the project.

- **styles.css**: Custom styles for the Quarto document to enhance presentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd functional-programming-python
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed along with any necessary libraries. You may need to install Quarto for rendering the document.

4. **Render the Document**: Use Quarto to render the `Summary.qmd` file into your desired output format (HTML, PDF, etc.).

   ```bash
   quarto render Summary.qmd
   ```

5. **Explore the Code**: Check the `code/` directory for practical examples of functional programming concepts.
